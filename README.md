# Mailboox-Rust - A distributed liberary powered by Holochain

**Application synopsis**
Enter the books that are in your bookshelf in order to make them visible to your community. Users can request to borrow books from each other and if possible the owner can put the book in his/her Mailbox in order to make it easily available for the borrower to pick-up. 

**Installation**
This application uses the Holochain distributed data storage engine as backend. It uses Distributed Hash Tables to create content addressable spaces where users are able to find the books that have been made available. 

In order to run the application (*not working yet!*) you will need to install Holochain on your machine. Find more information on this at https://github.com/holochain/holochain-rust
